## An logger class for easy and aesthetically pleasing console logging

### More details coming soon.

# Important notes:
* We use github's auto repo namer, so things could get interesting.
* We use docsify for docs on **all** our repos. You can find the docsify docs [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify)
* The Codeowners file deafults to _* @J-dogcoder_, but that will be adapted based on the repo when turned into an active project.
